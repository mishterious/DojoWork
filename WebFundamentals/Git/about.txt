Git diff --stat ___hash____(gives a log of the changes since that version)


Reverting:
Git revert -n HEAD
Git revert -n <commit hash> (if you don't put in a commit hash, it will automatically set it to HEAD>
*Always revert backwards in order of last commits"
Git reset <commit hash> --hard (when you need to completely erase the changes to a particular version)
Git reset <commit hash> <filename> --hard (when you want to reset the changes to a particular file but not the whole project back to a particular version)
